# SRS

SRS is the slop Rust stack: a downstream Rust toolchain repository that carries
the patched Cranelift backend needed to compile Astral workloads on macOS arm64.

## Layout

- `rust/`: the downstream Rust source tree that builds the toolchain and owns
  the `compiler/rustc_codegen_cranelift` integration.
- `rust/src/tools/cargo/`: Cargo, tracked as ordinary SRS content because
  bootstrap requires it at this path.
- `rust/src/tools/clippy/`: Clippy, also tracked as ordinary SRS content.
- `cranelift/`: the patched Wasmtime/Cranelift source tree consumed by the
  backend in `rust/`.
- `sld/`: the downstream `sld` linker source tree.
- `bootstrap.toml`: Rust bootstrap configuration for the SRS toolchain build.
- `build.sh`: builds `sld`, then a stage 2 Rust toolchain with LLVM and
  Cranelift backends, plus Cargo from the Rust tree.
- `build-sld.sh`: builds the `sld` binary, using the linked SRS toolchain by
  default when called directly.
- `scripts/pull-upstream.sh`: refreshes the imported downstream source trees
  from their upstream repositories for review.
- `scripts/build-apple-containers.sh`: builds the Linux x86_64 SRS lane from
  macOS through Apple containers.
- `install.sh`: clones or copies the built stage 2 toolchain into an immutable
  per-name snapshot, attaches copied SRS Cargo plus `sld`, and links that
  snapshot into rustup under a custom name.
- `cargo-srs.sh`: the installed Cargo wrapper that keeps build scripts, proc
  macros, and their host-side dependencies on LLVM, and starts the macOS arm64
  incremental-link lane with LLVM target artifacts.
- `with-sld.sh`: runs a command with the macOS Rust flags needed to link
  through SRS's built `sld` binary.

The bootstrap config keeps LLVM first in `rust.codegen-backends` and forces the
bootstrap build back through LLVM. The Rust source tree makes the installed
macOS arm64 and Linux x86_64 compilers prefer Cranelift for normal SRS target
artifacts. The installed Cargo wrapper keeps build scripts, proc macros, and
their host-side dependencies on LLVM because those helpers run during the
build and can exercise host intrinsics that Cranelift does not support yet.
For the first integrated macOS arm64 incremental-link lane, the wrapper also
selects LLVM for ordinary target artifacts. Set
`SRS_TARGET_CODEGEN_BACKEND=cranelift` to exercise the composed backend path
explicitly. Linux target behavior remains unchanged. For macOS arm64, SRS bakes
`sld` in as rustc's default linker.

## Quick Start

Initialize the remaining external dependency submodules after cloning SRS:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The top-level `rust/`, `cranelift/`, and `sld/` trees are already present in the
SRS checkout. Cargo and Clippy are already present under `rust/src/tools/`.
Submodules are reserved for nested external dependencies such as LLVM,
documentation repositories, test suites, and linker fixtures.

Build a stage 2 toolchain and link it into rustup as `srs`:

```bash
./build.sh
./install.sh
```

Check that rustup can see it:

```bash
rustc +srs -Vv
cargo +srs -Vv
```

`./build.sh` is the slow step. Re-run it after changing Rust, Cargo, Clippy,
cg_clif, Cranelift, or the linker default. It builds `sld` with `stable` first so the
installer can attach the built binary. Rust bootstrap stays on the system
compiler driver while the installed SRS compiler defaults to `sld`; set
`SRS_SLD_BOOTSTRAP_TOOLCHAIN` to choose another existing rustup toolchain for
that step. `./install.sh` snapshots the resulting stage 2 sysroot under
`${SRS_INSTALL_ROOT:-$HOME/code/tmp/srs-toolchains}/srs`. The installer uses
copy-on-write filesystem clones where available and a portable copy fallback
otherwise. It also copies the Cargo wrapper, Cargo binary, and `sld`, so an
installed name continues to work after later rebuilds or source-worktree
cleanup. Mutable bootstrap `rust-src` symlinks back into the source checkout
are intentionally omitted from the installed snapshot. Explicit sysroots with
copied `rust-src` directories keep those sources. A normal bootstrap snapshot
remains suitable for normal `rustc`, Cargo, and `sld` development builds after
source-worktree cleanup, but is not a `rust-src`-bearing toolchain. Workflows
that require compiler sources inside the sysroot, such as Cargo `-Z build-std`,
must use the task worktree's stage 2 sysroot instead. If that worktree has
already been removed, recreate and rebuild one; replacing an installed
snapshot intentionally does not restore the mutable `rust-src` symlinks.

On Apple silicon macOS, use Apple containers to exercise the Linux x86_64 build
lane locally:

```bash
container system start
./scripts/build-apple-containers.sh
```

The script mounts SRS at `/work`, runs an amd64 Linux Rust image with Rosetta,
installs the Linux build dependencies in that disposable container, and keeps
its build output under `target/apple-containers/`. It passes additional
arguments through to `build.sh`, for example
`./scripts/build-apple-containers.sh --dry-run -v`. Set
`SRS_APPLE_CONTAINER_IMAGE`, `SRS_APPLE_CONTAINER_MEMORY`,
`SRS_APPLE_CONTAINER_CPUS`, or `SRS_APPLE_CONTAINER_DNS` to tune the container
run.

## Usage

The SRS compiler still has Cranelift available. Its Cargo wrapper uses LLVM for
host build helpers and, on macOS arm64, for ordinary target artifacts in the
first integrated incremental-link lane. On macOS arm64 it links through the
`sld` binary attached to the installed toolchain:

```bash
cargo +srs build
```

The installed Cargo wrapper sets `SLD_INCREMENTAL=1` by default so `sld` can
reuse link state across development builds. On Apple silicon macOS, it also
requests signed private root-executable outputs and transient-input
stabilization from the patched Cargo binary. Rustc also supplies SLD with
persisted work-product digests so unchanged root objects can retain isolated
stable aliases without rereading their contents. Public artifacts remain detached
copies, while dependencies and build scripts do not inherit the root-link
environment. For target artifacts the macOS arm64 wrapper also enables
`-Zpreserve-duplicate-constants=yes`, preventing LLVM builds from coalescing
distinct string constants into a layout change that cannot be incrementally
patched. This intentionally trades some target object size for stable link
layout. Linux incremental-link behavior is unchanged. Set `SLD_INCREMENTAL=0`
for a full-link comparison or when diagnosing incremental-link behavior, set
`SRS_PRESERVE_DUPLICATE_LLVM_CONSTANTS=0` to compare LLVM without
compiler-side preservation, or set
`SRS_TARGET_CODEGEN_BACKEND=cranelift` for an explicit Cranelift composition
run.

The private-output mode assumes root executable links resolve to `sld`; the
installed toolchain default satisfies that contract. Cargo does not verify
linker identity. When deliberately selecting another linker through Cargo
configuration, environment rustflags, or `cargo rustc` arguments, set
`SLD_INCREMENTAL=0` so the wrapper does not enable private-output preservation.

The wrapper also enables Cargo's verified ordinary-library artifact cache at
`${CARGO_HOME:-$HOME/.cargo}/srs-artifact-cache-v2`. Dependencies compiled from
a shared source location, such as registry packages, can be restored by
hardlink across SRS worktrees on macOS and Linux; separate local checkouts
remain distinct when their source location can affect output. Restoration
copies automatically when the cache and build directory are on different
filesystems.

The wrapper's macOS duplicate-constant preservation flag and SLD
provenance-bearing dependency rlibs participate in cache keys. Root
executables remain outside the shared cache.

Cargo detaches restored hardlinks before rebuilding them, but tools outside
Cargo must not overwrite restored `.rlib` or `.rmeta` files in place: in
hardlink mode, those files share storage with the central cache. Use copy
materialization when a workflow mutates build artifacts after compilation.
Changing materialization mode or disabling the cache does not eagerly detach
already-fresh outputs. Run one Cargo build with the new setting or clean the
target directory before allowing an external tool to mutate artifacts
previously restored by hardlink.

See [Shared Cargo artifact cache](context/shared-cargo-artifact-cache.md) for
the cache admission rules, compiler identity model, concurrency behavior, and
operational details.

Set `SRS_CARGO_ARTIFACT_CACHE=0` to disable shared artifact restoration and
publication.
Set `SRS_CARGO_ARTIFACT_CACHE_DIR` to choose a different central cache root or
`SRS_CARGO_ARTIFACT_CACHE_MATERIALIZATION=copy` to retain cache reuse without
hardlink materialization. The cache is unbounded by default; set
`SRS_CARGO_ARTIFACT_CACHE_MAX_SIZE`, for example to `100GiB`, when a logical
byte cap is appropriate. `cargo clean` leaves the central cache intact. The
dedicated cache documentation describes the remaining controls, precedence
rules, manual reclamation, and trust assumptions.

SRS also builds and installs Clippy. By default, its `--fix` mode checks the
same dependencies as a plain Clippy run, so workspace-member artifacts remain
reusable when applying suggestions that Clippy just reported:

```bash
cargo +srs clippy --fix
```

When a plain Clippy run uses `--no-deps` to lint only the selected crate, repeat
`--no-deps` explicitly when applying its suggestions:

```bash
cargo +srs clippy --no-deps
cargo +srs clippy --fix --no-deps
```

`with-sld.sh` is useful when the `sld` choice needs to be explicit, such as
testing a non-installed linker binary or composing the linker with another
toolchain:

```bash
./with-sld.sh cargo +srs build
```

The wrapper sets the `RUSTFLAGS` form used by sld's own macOS Rust workflows:
`-C linker=<sld> -C link-arg=-flavor -C link-arg=darwin`. By default it uses
the `sld` binary from `./build-sld.sh` at `target/sld/opt/sld`; set
`SRS_SLD_BIN` to test another binary. Normal `cargo +srs` commands do not need
the wrapper after `./install.sh`.

Use a separate rustup toolchain name when keeping multiple SRS builds linked:

```bash
./install.sh srs-dev
cargo +srs-dev build
```

Installed names are immutable snapshots. After rebuilding, refresh an existing
name by explicitly replacing its snapshot:

```bash
SRS_INSTALL_REPLACE=1 ./install.sh srs-dev
```

Set `SRS_INSTALL_ROOT=/path/to/snapshots` to store the snapshots elsewhere.

The installer also accepts an explicit stage 2 sysroot and Cargo binary:

```bash
./install.sh srs-dev /path/to/stage2 /path/to/cargo
```

Set `SRS_SLD_BIN=/path/to/sld` when installing an alternate `sld` binary.

## Development

All downstream source changes are ordinary SRS changes. Create one SRS
worktree per task, edit `rust/`, `cranelift/`, `sld/`, or
`rust/src/tools/{cargo,clippy}/` directly, and commit the resulting files in
SRS. The SRS branch is the only branch needed for downstream development.

Read [`context/how-to-use-worktrees.md`](context/how-to-use-worktrees.md) before
starting concurrent work.

Refresh imported source trees through the reviewable upstream-update script:

```bash
before="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
./scripts/pull-upstream.sh rust
git log --oneline "$before"..HEAD
git diff --stat "$before"..HEAD
git diff "$before"..HEAD
```

Pass one of `rust`, `cargo`, `cranelift`, or `sld`, plus an optional upstream
ref. The script creates reviewable import and metadata commits. Review those
commits and run appropriate validation before sharing them.
After pulling an SRS change that advances a nested external dependency pin,
initialize or refresh those external dependencies before rebuilding:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Never push branches or open pull requests unless the user explicitly asks for
that public action.
