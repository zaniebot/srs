# Benchmarking sld

## Benchmarking against other linkers

If you decide to benchmark sld against other linkers, in order to make it a fair comparison, you
should ensure that the other linkers aren't doing work on something that sld doesn't support. In
particular:

* sld defaults to `--gc-sections`, so for a fair comparison, that should be passed to all the linkers.
* sld defaults to `-z now`, so best to pass that to all linkers.

## How to benchmark

### Preparing the "run-with" files

For benchmarking the linker, it's preferable to run just the linker, not the whole build process.

The way to do that is by capturing the linker invocation so that it can be rerun. sld has a
built-in way to do that.

You can benchmark linking of either a debug or a release build of a crate, this depends on what
comparisons you wish to make, or what change in sld you want to quantify.

Follow-these steps:

* Chose the crate that you wish to use in your benchmark, clone it, `cd` into it's root directory
  and make sure it builds with `cargo build` (for a rust project)
    * Examples: [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep.git)
* Clean the build using `cargo clean`
* To force the build of your chosen crate to link using sld, we have a couple of options:
    * Prefix the cargo build command with `RUSTFLAGS="-Clinker=clang -Clink-arg=--ld-path=sld"`
    * Modify (or add) the `.cargo/config.toml` file in your chosen crate (example for `ripgrep`)

```toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = "clang"
rustflags = ["-Clink-arg=--ld-path=sld"]
```

* Make sure that you have a version of sld in your `$PATH` so that it will be used (try `which
  sld` to check)
* Run `SLD_SAVE_BASE=/tmp/sld/ripgrep cargo build` in the crate's root directory (include
  `RUSTFLAGS` as above if you have chosen that method)
* You will get a few numbered subdirectories in `/tmp/sld/ripgrep` as part of the build process.
    * Directories will be created for builds of build scripts, proc macros and crate binaries built
    * Usually the last numbered subdirectory will be the build of crate's binary (if a single binary
      is built)
    * You can check what each file is linking using `tail -n 1 /tmp/sld/ripgrep/*/run-with`
    * In the case of ripgrep it is '6'
* You can then run `/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with sld` and that will rerun the link with sld

When you run `run-with sld`, the linker may print warnings for unsupported flags. It's a good idea
to edit the `run-with` script to change / delete these flags. This will make comparison with other
linkers more fair, since some of these unsupported flags may involve other linkers doing significant
amounts of extra work.

Native macOS benchmarks use the same saved-link workflow, but Darwin save-dirs need a slightly
different capture and replay path when comparing sld against Apple clang. See
[context/benchmarking-macos.md](context/benchmarking-macos.md).

### Benchmarking incremental mode

The benchmark runner can pass extra flags for specific benchmark entries. To measure sld's
incremental no-change path for an existing save-dir, add another benchmark entry that points at the
same save-dir and passes `--incremental` only to sld:

```toml
[bench.ripgrep-incremental]
save = "ripgrep"
skip_linkers = ["bfd", "lld", "mold"]
sld_extra_flags = ["--incremental"]
expect_sld_log = ["reused existing output before loading inputs"]
```

The runner performs a warmup run first, so the timed runs measure reuse of the incremental state.

To measure changed-input incremental relinks, use `mutate_files` with paths relative to the
save-dir. A string entry appends one zero byte to the listed file before every timed run. A table
entry with `path` and `section` flips the first byte of that ELF section instead, which is useful
when the benchmark should prove that changed inputs also change the linked output. A table entry
with `grow` increases the ELF section size by that many bytes, provided there is padding before the
next object structure. Mutations replace their input file atomically, matching how Rust build
artifacts are published and preserving hardlinked prior-input snapshots used by incremental sld.
To let the linked output absorb grown sections instead of relying only on alignment padding, pass
`--incremental-padding-percent=N` in `sld_extra_flags`. The warmup run is not mutated, so it seeds
the initial incremental state; each timed run then measures a real changed-input relink. Use
`expect_output_change = true` with section mutations when you want the runner to assert that the
benchmarked mutation changes the linked output, not just the input file metadata. Use a scratch
copy of the save-dir, since this intentionally mutates inputs.
When a table entry has `section` but no `path`, the runner finds the first relocatable ELF input
with a matching section at runtime. A trailing `*` makes the section name a prefix match, which is
useful for Rust objects with names like `.text._ZN...`.
When a table entry has `incremental_patch`, the runner instead reads the incremental state emitted
by the warmup sld link and finds a recorded directly patchable object or archive-member section
with matching bytes in the linked output. This is useful for saved links where choosing an
arbitrary section can silently measure a fallback full relink. It requires an sld benchmark binary.
The runner resolves the section once per benchmark cohort, then mutates that same byte for every
timed edit. The usual `expect_sld_log` and `expect_output_change` checks should still be enabled.

```toml
[bench.ripgrep-incremental-changed]
save = "ripgrep"
skip_linkers = ["bfd", "lld", "mold"]
sld_extra_flags = ["--incremental"]
mutate_files = ["path/to/input.o"]
```

```toml
[bench.ripgrep-incremental-changed-data]
save = "ripgrep"
skip_linkers = ["bfd", "lld", "mold"]
sld_extra_flags = ["--incremental"]
mutate_files = [{ path = "path/to/input.o", section = ".data" }]
expect_sld_log = ["patched ", "changed input file before loading inputs"]
expect_output_change = true
```

```toml
[bench.ripgrep-incremental-grown-data]
save = "ripgrep"
skip_linkers = ["bfd", "lld", "mold"]
sld_extra_flags = ["--incremental", "--incremental-padding-percent=25"]
mutate_files = [{ path = "path/to/input.o", section = ".data", grow = 1 }]
expect_sld_log = ["patched ", "changed input file before loading inputs"]
expect_output_change = true
```

```toml
[bench.ripgrep-incremental-changed-text]
save = "ripgrep"
sld_extra_flags = ["--incremental"]
mutate_files = [{ section = ".text.*" }]
expect_sld_log = ["patched ", "changed input", "before loading inputs"]
expect_output_change = true
```

```toml
[bench.uv-incremental-recorded-patch]
save = "uv"
sld_extra_flags = ["--incremental"]
mutate_files = [{ incremental_patch = "__const" }]
expect_sld_log = ["patched ", "changed input", "before loading inputs"]
expect_output_change = true
```

The checked-in `benchmarks/incremental-linux.toml` file uses that automatic input discovery for
`ruff`, `ty`, and `uv`, and leaves `bfd`, `lld`, and `mold` enabled so the same changed-input run can
show sld incremental speedup against the default linker and mold. When `report --print-stats` sees
paired full and incremental benchmarks, it also prints the incremental speedup over the full sld
link for the same project.

The checked-in incremental Linux benchmarks pass `--no-fork` to linkers that support it. This keeps
sld and mold timings on the actual linker process and prevents incremental timed runs from racing
with a still-running forked child that is writing incremental state.

Those same benchmarks pin explicit changed-input object sections. The automatic section selector is
useful for ad-hoc experiments, but large Rust debug links can contain early objects with anonymous
patch metadata that should fall back instead of patching.

`expect_sld_log` is optional, but useful when benchmarking incremental mode: after the warmup
that seeds incremental state, it fails timed sld runs whose incremental log doesn't contain the
expected fast-path message, so you don't accidentally measure a full fallback relink.

### Run benchmark with hyperfine

Let's benchmark the linking stage between `ld`, `mold` and `sld`, discarding the first two runs of
each to reduce the effects of cache warmup

```shell
hyperfine --warmup 2 '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with ld' '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with mold' '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with sld'
```

That should produce output similar to this (with different values):

```text
Benchmark 1: /tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with ld
  Time (mean ± σ):     954.1 ms ±  13.6 ms    [User: 683.4 ms, System: 268.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):   920.6 ms … 970.7 ms    10 runs
 
Benchmark 2: /tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with mold
  Time (mean ± σ):     146.1 ms ±   3.6 ms    [User: 52.0 ms, System: 2.4 ms]
  Range (min … max):   139.1 ms … 154.7 ms    19 runs
 
Benchmark 3: /tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with sld
  Time (mean ± σ):      87.7 ms ±   2.8 ms    [User: 2.4 ms, System: 2.0 ms]
  Range (min … max):    81.5 ms …  92.5 ms    34 runs
 
Summary
  /tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with sld ran
    1.67 ± 0.07 times faster than /tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with mold
   10.88 ± 0.38 times faster than /tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with ld
```

### Run benchmark with poop

An alternative tool to hyperfine, that reports some additional metrics is [`poop`](https://github.com/andrewrk/poop).

Like hyperfine it takes a number of commands and runs each a number of times and gathers statistics about each tune.

```shell
poop '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with ld' '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with mold' '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with sld'
```

It should produce output similar to this (with different numbers!):

```text

```

NOTE: Both `mold` and `sld` fork a child process and perform linking in it. Thus, the values for
`peak_rss`, `User` and `System` are for the parent process only, and hence are not representative of
real use by the linker. To avoid this problem, pass `--no-fork` to mold and sld.

NOTE: `poop` uses the first command as the reference the others are compared against, so if focusing
on sld, you might want to re-order the commands and invoke `poop` thus:

```text
poop '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with sld' '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with mold' '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with ld'
```

### Comparisons

Using this method, you can benchmark:

* between sld and one or more other linkers
* between different options passed to sld - You can pass arbitrary additional arguments to run-with.
  The first argument needs to be the name of the linker to use. All additional arguments are passed through to the
  linker as-is

### Caching

The use of the linux file system cache affects linker performance, as there is a lot of reasonably
large files read and written. In a normal build, the object files being linked would be written previously by the
compiler and may well be in the file cache. With this benchmarking method we skip the previous build steps and the
linker incurs the penalty of reading those files into cache the first time they are read.

To reduce the effect this has on benchmarked time we run hyperfine with the `--warmup 2` option, and the results
of the first two runs are not used in the calculations.

### Disk write bottlenecks

When benchmarking, if the output file is being written to persistent storage (hard disk or SSD), the
writes can build up and cause the linkers to block. Worse, writes from a previous linker invocation
might contribute to this backlog. Whether this happens depends on how much RAM you have free and
also your kernel settings. For example, if you run `cat /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio` that will show the
percentage of reclaimable memory that is allowed to be dirty (needing writing) before further writes
will block. If that shows zero, then `cat /proc/sys/vm/dirty_bytes` will show the same, but as an
absolute number of bytes. On some systems, the absolute dirty byte limit might be set as low as
256MiB, meaning that if we're writing a large output file, we can easily hit this limit. You could
increase this limit, or switch to using `dirty_ratio` of say 20% instead, but it might be better to
just take the filesystem out of the equation and write the output to a tmpfs instead. See next
section.

### Tmpfs

As discussed in the last section, writing to a physical disk can cause inconsistent benchmark
results. It can also contribute to wearing out your SSD. For these reasons, it's recommended to
benchmark with the output file on tmpfs.

If you don't already have a suitable tmpfs to use, you can create one something like the following:

```sh
sudo mkdir /benchmark
sudo mount -t tmpfs none /benchmark
```

Then when running the benchmark, set the output file to be on this filesystem. e.g.:

```sh
OUT=/benchmark/out hyperfine --warmup 2 '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with ld' '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with mold' '/tmp/sld/ripgrep/6/run-with sld'
```

### Watch out for thermal throttling

If your CPUs get hot while running the benchmark, this can cause inconsistent results. You can check
for throttle events by looking for increases in
`/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/thermal_throttle/package_throttle_count` and
`/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/thermal_throttle/core_throttle_count` between when you start the
benchmark and when you finish. Ideally, these should be unchanged.

One thing that can help is if you have a way to turn your fans to maximum before you start the
benchmark run.

Another possibility is to give the CPUs a chance to cool down between each run, e.g. by sleeping.
With `hyperfine`, you can do this by adding an argument like `--prepare "sleep 2"`. You might need
to experiment with the duration of the sleep.

## What to benchmark

### rustc

When building rustc, most of the rustc code goes into a shared object called rustc-driver. This
shared object is about 230 MiB without debug info and 462 MiB with debug info. While not as large as
some binaries, this is still a pretty reasonable size, making it good for benchmarking. It's also an
interesting benchmark because it's a shared object rather than an executable.

Before building rustc, edit or create `bootstrap.toml` in your `rust` directory to contain:

```toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = "clang"
rustflags = ["-Clink-arg=--ld-path=sld"]
```

Now rustc will use sld as the linker on every build. You must have sld in your PATH.
In the following command, replace `$SLD_REPO_PATH` with the path to the directory containing the sld repo. You'll
need to have already built sld with `cargo build --release`.

To build rustc just cd into the rust repo root and run:

```sh
PATH="$SLD_REPO_PATH/target/release:$PATH" SLD_SAVE_BASE=/tmp/rustc-link ./x build rustc
```

For more information about building rustc see [building instructions on the rustc-dev-guide](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html).
You should now have a few subdirectories under `/tmp/rustc-link`. You can identify which one is
`rustc_driver` by looking at the last line of the `run-with` script in each directory.

If the directory `/tmp/rustc-link` didn't get created, then most likely sld wasn't used to
link.

### Other tools

* [poop](https://github.com/andrewrk/poop) - gives a lot of measurements other than just time. Note
  that the `peak_rss` measurement won't be accurate for sld and mold unless you include the
  `--no-fork` argument to the linker.

## Profiling

### --time

To figure out where sld is spending time, the first option is to run with `--time`. It's
recommended to combine this with `--no-fork`. For example:

For incremental links launched by an outer build system, set `SLD_TIME=1` instead of injecting
`--time` into build flags. This enables the same default phase report without changing the
compiler or build-system command line used to produce the incremental link.

```

If a benchmark has shown a significant increase in say CPU cycles or instructions, then it can be
useful to check which phase or phases that increase has occurred in. You can get per-phase cycle and
instruction counts by running with `--time=cycles,instructions`. To see the full list of counters,
search `args.rs` for "branch-misses".

### Perfetto

The `--time` flag only shows the course stages of the linker. To see what each thread is doing
during each stage, we can capture a perfetto trace and view the results in the perfetto UI.

Start by building with the `perfetto` feature enabled:

```sh
cargo build --release --features perfetto
```

Run the linker with `SLD_PERFETTO_OUT` set to some file. e.g.:

```sh
SLD_PERFETTO_OUT=$HOME/tmp/tmp.pftrace ./run-with sld
```

Open the [perfetto UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev/). Click "Open trace file" and select `tmp.pftrace`.
Use the keys w, a, s, d to navigate (scroll and zoom).

### Structured timing traces

For programmatic analysis, set `SLD_TIMING_TRACE_OUT` to write a JSON timing trace. This does not
require the `perfetto` feature and includes both the coarse phases shown by `--time` and
fine-grained worker spans:

```sh
SLD_TIMING_TRACE_OUT=$HOME/code/tmp/link.json ./run-with sld --no-fork
```

The output is versioned as `sld-timing-trace` schema version `1`. All timestamps and durations are
monotonic nanoseconds relative to the start of tracing. Each span records `id`, `parent_id`,
`thread_id`, `name`, `detail`, `start_ns`, `duration_ns`, and any span attributes. A `parent_id`
only identifies nesting in the same tracing execution context; work performed by separate worker
threads can overlap without sharing a parent span. Consequently, agents should use the outer
`Invocation` span for measured linker wall time and inspect overlapping detail spans for
attribution rather than summing all detail durations.

Structured tracing begins after argument parsing and before thread-pool activation. Passing
`--no-fork` is recommended when collecting a trace for analysis so process handoff does not obscure
the invocation being measured.

### Samply

To look for hot functions and to check how the work distribution looks between threads, you can use
[samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply).

For this to be useful, you likely want optimisations and debug info. We have an `opt-debug` profile
set up for this purpose.

```sh
cargo build --profile opt-debug
```

```sh
~/tmp/rustc-link/0/run-with samply record target/opt-debug/sld --strip-debug
```

The result will look something [like this](https://share.firefox.dev/4eORM7r). This is using the
Firefox profiler, so you'll need to open that link in Firefox.

One thing you'll likely notice when looking at the flamegraph is that there's lots of rayon stuff
and that makes it hard to see what's going on. The issue is that rayon uses recursion and the exact
sequence of calls it goes through before it gets to our code varies. The trick to seeing through
this is to collapse that recursion. For example, find
`rayon::iter::plumbing::bridge_producer_consumer::helper`, right click and select `Collapse
recursion` (or 'r'). If there's any extra rayon stack frames that you'd like to ignore, you can
select them and press 'm' to merge them.

### Heap profiling with dhat

Build with profiling enabled:

```sh
cargo build --profile opt-debug --features dhat
```

Then run the linker on some input. e.g:

```sh
~/tmp/rustc-link/0/run-with target/opt-debug/sld --no-fork
```

This should print some stats on exit. e.g.:

```
dhat: Total:     250,699,127 bytes in 130,224 blocks
dhat: At t-gmax: 111,265,627 bytes in 14,117 blocks
dhat: At t-end:  96,320 bytes in 109 blocks
dhat: The data has been saved to dhat-heap.json, and is viewable with dhat/dh_view.html
```

You can then upload `dhat-heap.json` to the [online dhat
viewer](https://nnethercote.github.io/dh_view/dh_view.html).

### Generating report-style benchmarks

Benchmarks such as [benchmarks/ryzen-9955hx.md](benchmarks/ryzen-9955hx.md) are generated using the
tool in `benchmarks/runner`. You'll need a directory containing one or more "save-dirs" where the
names of the directories are the names of the benchmarks.

```sh
cargo run --bin benchmark-runner -- \
    bench --config benchmarks/ryzen-9955hx.toml --save ~/save linker1 linker2 linker3
cargo run --bin benchmark-runner -- report
```
